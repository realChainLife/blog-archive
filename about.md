</ul>

With over a decade of professional experience, and five years working as an
independent consultant, I have been trusted by the likes of the <b>United
Nations</b>, <b>Google</b>, the <b>BBC</b>, <b>General Electric</b>, and [many
more](/#section:clients). Through combinations of workshops, training, audits,
development, and consultancy, I have helped my clients to build and scale
resilient, performant front-ends for a variety of different applications.

  <p>There is a short list of people I whole-heartedly recommend for detailed
  performance work and Harry is right there at the top.</p>

Internationally recognised as a leading expert in CSS architecture and front-end
performance, it is my job to help companies accomplish the **return on
investment** that web performance efforts can bring, whether that is increasing
conversions, improving engagement, or **growing revenues**. I thrive on being
a business-focused engineer, equally comfortable in front of C-level executives
as I am in front of a room full of developers.

Most importantly, I am **available for hire**. My work spans many industries,
countries, and formats. From troubleshooting and assessing existing performance
issues, to training engineers to debug and avoid these common pitfalls in
future; from **advising and consulting** with teams to get a handle on web
performance issues, to everything else in between. If you need a faster website,
we’ll get you a faster website.

If you think I can help you—and I probably can—**say hello**: I enjoy working
with companies of all shapes, sizes, locations, problems, needs, and budgets.
I’m professional, but I’m laid back—[drop me a line](/contact/), and we can see
what fits.
